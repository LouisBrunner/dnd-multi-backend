# DnD Multi Backend [![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![Build Status][ci-image] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

This project is a Drag'n'Drop backend compatible with [DnD Core](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd).

It enables your application to use different DnD backends depending on the situation. Different packages are available depending on your front-end framework:

  - React: [`react-dnd-multi-backend`](packages/react-dnd-multi-backend)
  - Angular: [`angular-skyhook`](https://github.com/cormacrelf/angular-skyhook) (see [documentation](https://cormacrelf.github.io/angular-skyhook/angular-skyhook-multi-backend/) for more information)
  - Any: [`dnd-multi-backend`](packages/dnd-multi-backend)

This project also contains some helpers (available standalone or included in other packages):

 - React DnD Preview: [`react-dnd-preview`](packages/react-dnd-preview) (included in `react-dnd-multi-backend`)
